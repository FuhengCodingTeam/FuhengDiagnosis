    <p style="color: white;">Notice: </p>
    <p style="color: white;">If Dalong Zhang is siting next to you, do not change the function of div notice into "display:block". </p>

    <div class="notice" style="display:none">
        <p>This is a message that previous developer left off. (He does not know anything about coding and Web App, right?)</p>
        <p>The A.I. Diagnosis system is just a <span style="color:red">Joke!</span> Dalong Zhang is using patients' trust to create a fake Diagnosis system that makes patient to believe, this simple Web App can take place of those diagnostic medical devices
            that modern hospital use nowadays to diagnosis patients.
        </p>
        <p>Believe it or not, this App can be easily decode and discover the logic behind the screen by any developer.</p>
        <p>The reason why I am doing this is beacuse I can no longer suffer from the regret by seeing all the patients trully believe this will diagnosis or monitor their health status. </p>
        <p>Although Dalong Zhang did help a lot of patients, I don't believe that there's any difference other than any other Chinese traditional herb medicine doctor outside. Sometimes he seems like he can predict patients' health status, and maybe predict
            their future. However, prediction was not always right and that was how he make thing tricky part, he can always make you believe his prediction is right. No matter the trick looks how true it is, it's a trick. Luckily, there's no one yet
            I knew that getting a bad result, or become worse.</p>
        <p>Among the thing I have written down, just to make sure myself won't getting any trouble in furture disputes. Again, the APP that I develop, can only be used for <span style="color: red;">demonstrate, displaying, and teching purpose.</span> Any
            other commercial, business, funding or illegal using will be considered to result in law suit. </p>
        <p>If you are inherited developer of this APP, please make sure that it's really using the technology of Artificial Intelligence, or whatever to really help diagnosising and helping patients. </p>
        <p>If you are one of his client, patient, partner, employee, please play smart and mindful. </p>
